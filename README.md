# Still-Birth-project
Stillbirth, defined as the loss of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation, remains a critical public health challenge, affecting 1 in 160 births globally. In India, the situation is even more pressing, with a stillbirth rate of 23 per 1,000 births. Early detection and prediction of stillbirth are crucial for improving maternal and fetal outcomes.
